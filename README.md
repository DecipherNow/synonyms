Synonyms Service
================

A small service for returning the synonyms for each meaningful word in a sentence using the WordNet 3.1 synset database.

Building and Installing
-----------------------

### Manually

The synonyms service is written in [golang](https://golang.org/). If Go is correctly installed, we should be able to acquire and install the source in the usual way with

```{bash}
go get github.com/deciphernow/synonyms
go install github.com/deciphernow/synonyms
```

### With Docker

For quickest results, we can use the prebuilt image on Docker Hub:

```{bash}
docker pull deciphernow/synonyms
```

Alternatively, to build synonyms in a container:

```{bash}
# from the repo root:
docker run --rm \
           -v "$PWD":/go/src/github.com/deciphernow/synonyms \
           -w /go/src/github.com/deciphernow/synonyms \
           iron/go:dev \
           go build -o synonyms
```

Which produces a "synonyms" Linux binary in the repo root and terminates.

We then build the `deciphernow/synonyms` production image with

```{bash}
# still from the repo root:
docker build -t deciphernow/synonyms .
```

Starting
--------

### Manual Start

If $GOPATH/bin is in $PATH, we can launch the synonyms service with

```{bash}
synonyms [port]
```

Otherwise, run with

```{bash}
$GOPATH/bin/synonyms [port]
```

### Docker Start

Once the `deciphernow/synonyms` image exists locally (see above), we can run it with, e.g.:

```{bash}
docker run --publish 8080:8080 --rm deciphernow/synonyms
```

This will run the `deciphernow/synonyms` image in a container, publishing internal port 8080 on external port 8080, and cleaning up the container filesystem upon exit.

Usage
-----

The service first checks for the presence of the WordNet database files in $TMPDIR/synonyms-service-wordnet-db/dict, and if not yet present, it downloads them (16Mb download, 53Mb uncompressed) to this location. Thereafter, the service listens on port 8080 (or first argument `port` if provided).

Synonyms supports text and JSON output. A simple GET to `localhost:8080?q=Hello, World!` will return

```
synonyms of 'hello': [hello hullo hi howdy how-do-you-do]
synonyms of 'world': [universe existence creation world cosmos macrocosm domain reality Earth earth globe populace public worldly_concern earthly_concern human_race humanity humankind human_beings humans mankind man]
```

and a GET to `localhost:8080/synonyms.json?q=Hello, World!` will return

```{json}

[{"word":"hello","synonyms":["hello","hullo","hi","howdy","how-do-you-do"]},{"word":"world","synonyms":["universe","existence","creation","world","cosmos","macrocosm","domain","reality","Earth","earth","globe","populace","public","worldly_concern","earthly_concern","human_race","humanity","humankind","human_beings","humans","mankind","man"]}]
```

The synonyms service also supports querying instead by header. A GET to `localhost:8080/synonyms.json` with the header `Q: Hello, World!` returns the same JSON output as above. Similarly, GET to `localhost:8080` with that header returns the same text output as above.

Roadmap
-------

A list of features and changes we'd like to make:

* ! Improve error handling (pass to requestor with accurate error code instead of dying)
* Load a third-party stop words list
* More sophisticated tokenization (e.g., better supporting contractions like "It's", which currently tokenizes as "it" and "s")
* A separate endpoint that applies heuristics to guess the *intended* WordNet sense of each word in a sentence, and return only the synset for that particular sense
